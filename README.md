# Shopify_Product_Formatter

This is a prototype I worked on for my internship at Ram4Global. It's made to simplify the process of formatting a product or inventory list to import it into shopify. I chose to write it in python since shopify provides libraries for it, and it works well with their API, so it would be a good language for future development.
